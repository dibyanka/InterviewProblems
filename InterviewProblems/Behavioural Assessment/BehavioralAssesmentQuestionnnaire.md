# These questions are to verify if the person fits the team:

## [Skill:  Enthusiasm for learning new skills]

1. Tell me about one of your experiences where you learnt a technical skill which was completely new to you? What were your steps in learning it?

2. How do you estimate your tasks?

3- How do you learn new item such as lambda function? Do you require a senior assistant or do you operate on your own individually?

4- How do complete the tasks given to you. Can you tell us the steps involved?

## [Skill: Operating System]

1. How do you prefer setting up a linux OS for development?

2. Have you worked with Command line, how much experience do you have?

## [Skill:  Team spirit and knowledge sharing]

1. How do you share your knowledge to the community/peers?

2. Do you prefer to work alone or pair programming? [pls don't say both of them] choose one and then back up your answer.

3. Another scenario is: you developed a piece of code and sent out for review. One of the peer  gave you comments on very small points, which you think doesn't matter because
your code works well, for e.g. He/she asks you to change the name of the variables or class. Or use spaces instead of tabs. And he/she won't approve unless you make these
changes. What would you do? 

## [Skill:  Multitasking]

1. Here is a situation, you are working on a task planned for the day but you are getting interrupted by your team members/seniors with different requests, which are unrelated to your task. How would you handle it? (tests multitasking skills)

<h1>These questions are to verify if the person fits the AVLM team:</h1>
<h2>[Skill: Enthusiasm for learning new skills]</h2>
<ol>
    <li>
        <p>Tell me about one of your experiences where you learnt a technical skill which was completely new to you?
            What were your steps in learning it?</p>
    </li>
    <li>
        <p>How do you estimate your tasks?</p>
    </li>
</ol>
<p>3- How do you learn new item such as lambda function? Do you require a senior assistant or do you operate on your own
    individually?</p>
<p>4- How do complete the tasks given to you. Can you tell us the steps involved?</p>
<h2>[Skill: Operating System]</h2>
<ol>
    <li>
        <p>How do you prefer setting up a linux OS for development?</p>
    </li>
    <li>
        <p>Command line not exposed too much but willing to learn and work with CLI tools. He worked with git command
            line.</p>
    </li>
</ol>
<h2>[Skill: Team spirit and knowledge sharing]</h2>
<ol>
    <li>
        <p>How do you share your knowledge to the community/peers?</p>
    </li>
    <li>
        <p>Do you prefer to work alone or pair programming? [pls don’t say both of them] choose one and then back up
            your answer.</p>
    </li>
    <li>
        <p>Another scenario is: you developed a piece of code and sent out for review. One of the peer gave you comments
            on very small points, which you think doesn’t matter because<br>
            your code works well, for e.g. He/she asks you to change the name of the variables or class. Or use spaces
            instead of tabs. And he/she won’t approve unless you make these<br>
            changes. What would you do?</p>
    </li>
</ol>
<h2>[Skill: Multitasking]</h2>
<ol>
    <li>Here is a situation, you are working on a task planned for the day but you are getting interrupted by your team
        members/seniors with different requests, which are unrelated to your task. How would you handle it? (tests
        multitasking skills)</li>
</ol>
